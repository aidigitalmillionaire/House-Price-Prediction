A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features like location, area, number of rooms, and amenities. This model aims to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate investors in making data-driven decisions in the housing market.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages regression-based machine learning algorithms to estimate property prices using structured housing datasets.
By analyzing factors like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other metrics, the model predicts the market value of a house with high accuracy.
